# dictos
A cross platform modern C++ abstraction library

This project is a playground for ideas I have on a framework that I would like to use in c++. I've built a few frameworks for various companies over the years and I have certain concepts I find useful, so I'm createing this repo to publically post my techniques. This is also my first real attempt at a 'Modern' approach to some of the design hurdles. I've never really written many meta templates, and so I'm taking the opportunity to learn them here. The dictos suite of libraries all require bleeding edge c++17 support in the toolchains and none of them should be used for anything requiring production quality (yet).
